I've made this project to learn about how the canvas api and touch events work on browsers.

## **NOTE:** 

Yes I know the code could be cleaner and there are some small bugs but I don't care I just wanted to make a canvas I can freely draw / take notes on inside Chrome.

## **For curious programmers:**

I've also made a server + client system that saves my canvases in a db as a PNG file. That was something else... I'd defiently recommend everyone try to make a similar app.
